in this we have index.js file that do both function like consumer and producer 

but after that we divide that process into two parts PROCERS and CONSUMER 
so first we have to do 
-npm run produce //with that produce event after that we run the command 
-npm run consume //with that consume event after that we run the command  and if math.random is there then show that event in all consumers if they all are in 1 groupId then that event show in 1 only consumer
